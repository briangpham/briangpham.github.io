## Brian Pham

I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at California State University, Long Beach, and I am currently on track to earn my Bachelor of Science in December 2024. I am studying with an emphasis in Digital Signal Processing, and I am also interested in topics involving Digital System Design, Communications, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

I have experience using MATLAB, VHDL, C++, and Python. I also have experience using Simulink and I am currently working with System Generator/Vitis Model Composer and Xilinx Vivado for DSP. I also have teaching experience as I am working at my university's College of Engineering as an Instructional Student Assistant and have worked as a Teaching Assistant. I am also proficient in using Microsoft Office Suite.

My current goals include pursuing a career as an FPGA firmware design engineer, and I am eager to learn more and obtain as much experience as possible in this field. I am looking for any internship opportunities relating to FPGA/ASIC design, DSP, and my topics of interest, but I am open to opportunities in relating fields. I am also looking to pursue graduate school and have plans on studying towards a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering.
